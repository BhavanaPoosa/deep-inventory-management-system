As part of a deep inventory management system project, my responsibility was to implement a cutting-edge YOLOv5 deep learning model using PyTorch. The goal was to enable dynamic detection and real-time updates of inventory items. The project aimed to enhance the frontend display through the Streamlit framework, facilitating seamless inventory management on mobile devices.

The primary tasks included implementing the YOLOv5 model for inventory item detection, achieving a remarkable detection speed of as low as 5ms per frame. Additionally, I was tasked with improving the frontend user interface using Streamlit. The application needed to stream items in real-time on mobile devices, where the deep learning model automatically updated the inventory count, reflecting the changes in the frontend. Dataset preparation was conducted using RoboFlow, and the backend, developed in Python using PyTorch, stored inventory items in an SQLite database. The entire web application was deployed on Streamlit Cloud for accessibility.

**Action:**
- **Deep Learning Model Implementation:**
  - Implemented the YOLOv5 model for accurate and dynamic detection of inventory items.
  - Achieved a high detection speed of 5ms per frame, ensuring real-time processing.

- **Frontend Development:**
  - Significantly enhanced the frontend using the Streamlit framework, providing an intuitive and user-friendly display.
  - Enabled real-time streaming of inventory items on mobile devices, offering a seamless user experience.

- **Dataset Preparation:**
  - Utilized RoboFlow for dataset preparation, ensuring a robust training set for the YOLOv5 model.
  
- **Backend Development:**
  - Developed the backend using Python and PyTorch, facilitating efficient communication between the frontend and the deep learning model.
  - Stored inventory items in an SQLite database for organized data management.

- **Deployment:**
  - Deployed the complete web application on Streamlit Cloud, ensuring scalability and accessibility for users.

**Result:**
- **Precision Improvement:**
  - Achieved a precision of 0.75, indicating that when the model predicts an object with a confidence score of at least 0.25, it is correct about 75% of the time.
  
- **Efficient Inventory Management:**
  - Successfully integrated the YOLOv5 model, allowing for automatic detection and real-time updates of inventory items.
  - Significantly improved the frontend display, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Scalability and Accessibility:**
  - Deployed the web application on Streamlit Cloud, ensuring scalability and easy access to the inventory management system.

This project showcased my ability to implement cutting-edge technologies, improve system efficiency, and deliver a user-friendly solution for real-time inventory management on mobile devices by simply picking and checking. The achieved precision of 0.75 at a confidence score of 0.25 reflects the model's accuracy in detecting inventory items.
